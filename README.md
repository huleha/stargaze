Stargaze is an application which helps you find the best spot for astronomical observations in your area, taking numerous factors into account, such as:

- Accessibility by road
- Remoteness from large populated areas, lit roads and major highways
- Light pollution
- Relief (view should not be obstructed by a hill)
- Physical and legal access to the observation spot
- and others
